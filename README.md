# Desolo Zantas

Desolo Zantas is a large-scale Celeste mod built on the `MaggyHelper` module. This repository contains the campaign maps, runtime code, dialogue, art, audio, Loenn metadata, and packaging setup used to build and ship the project.

`Desolo Zantas` is the public-facing mod name. `MaggyHelper` remains the internal assembly, namespace, and Everest module name used by the project.

## Ownership And Repository Policy

This Celeste mod project, including the Kirby-inspired mechanics and the content spanning the campaign through Chapter 20, was built from scratch for Desolo Zantas.

Public access is provided so players and followers can view development history, report bugs, and leave suggestions or feedback. Public access does not grant permission to modify, reuse, redistribute, or publish altered versions of this codebase or its assets.

Feedback is welcome through issues and discussion, but pull requests and unauthorized code or asset changes are not accepted unless the repository owner gives explicit written permission in advance.

- `Maps/Maggy/BSide`: B-Side campaign maps.
- `Maps/Maggy/CSide`: C-Side campaign maps.
- `Maps/Maggy/DSide`: D-Side campaign maps.
- `Maps/Maggy/DXSide`: DX-side folder reserved for extended content.
- `Maps/Maggy/Lobby`: Chapter lobby maps for the later-game submap structure.
- `Maps/Maggy/SmallMaps`: Fragment, shard, EX, and boss submaps.
- `Maps/Maggy/WIP`: In-progress maps and staging content.

## Notable Systems

- Custom first-launch selection screen that lets the player start Desolo Zantas directly or continue to the normal Celeste flow.
- Extended chapter-side support up to D-Side and DX-side through runtime area mode expansion.
- Sequential side unlock logic with save data tracking and custom unlock postcards.
- Chapter lobby and portal systems for Ruins, Snowdin, Wateredgefalls, Hotcliffland, and Cyber Nexus.
- Custom credits sequences, cutscenes, bosses, and chapter-specific progression hooks.

## Building

### Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK
- Celeste modding references available through `Source/lib-stripped` or a valid `CelestePrefix` pointing to a local Celeste install or reference directory

### Build Command

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet build MaggyHelper.sln
```

The default build copies the mod DLL and required runtime dependencies into `bin/`.

## Packaging

Release builds also create a packaged mod zip:

```powershell
dotnet build MaggyHelper.sln -c Release
```

This produces `MaggyHelper.zip` at the repository root and packages files from `everest.yaml`, `bin/`, `Audio/`, `Dialog/`, `Graphics/`, and `Loenn/`. The build script also includes `Ahorn/` content when that folder is present.

## Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are declared in `everest.yaml`. The mod currently depends on Everest plus a large helper stack, including AdventureHelper, CommunalHelper, FrostHelper, MaxHelpingHand, SkinModHelper, SkinModHelperPlus, and several other helper mods.

Use `everest.yaml` as the source of truth when preparing releases or validating player installs.

## Current Map Structure

The campaign uses a side-based folder layout instead of suffix-based filenames:

- `Maps/Maggy/ASide/01_City.bin`
- `Maps/Maggy/BSide/01_City.bin`
- `Maps/Maggy/CSide/01_City.bin`
- `Maps/Maggy/DSide/01_City.bin`

This keeps side content separated cleanly while matching the runtime path logic used by `AreaModeExtender`.

## Development Notes

- The codebase targets Everest mod workflows and includes stripped Celeste references under `Source/lib-stripped` for local builds.
- The README intentionally documents the public project identity as Desolo Zantas while preserving the internal MaggyHelper naming used by the codebase.
- DX-side support exists in code and folder structure, but the current DX map folder is still empty.
